# Duplicate Prompt Card Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The Chrome extension was creating duplicate prompt cards when users reopened the extension. This was caused by **multiple initialization** of the PromptHive class.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the initialization code at the end of `popup.js`:

1. **Lines 1503-1506**: First DOMContentLoaded listener
2. **Lines 1509-1516**: Conditional logic that added ANOTHER DOMContentLoaded listener OR initialized immediately

When the document was still loading, **both** listeners would fire, creating **two** PromptHive instances, each loading and rendering the same prompts.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Initialization (Primary Fix)
- **File**: `popup.js` (lines 1503-1520)
- **Solution**: Created a single `initializePromptHive()` function with safeguards
- **Changes**:
  - Added check for existing `promptHive` instance
  - Used `{ once: true }` option for event listener to ensure it only fires once
  - Simplified logic to avoid duplicate event listeners

### 2. Added Message Listener Safeguard
- **File**: `popup.js` (setupMessageListener method)
- **Solution**: Added `messageListenerSetup` flag to prevent duplicate listeners
- **Changes**:
  - Added property `this.messageListenerSetup = false` in constructor
  - Added check in `setupMessageListener()` to prevent duplicate registrations

### 3. Added Event Binding Safeguard
- **File**: `popup.js` (bindEvents method)
- **Solution**: Added `eventsBindingSetup` flag to prevent duplicate event binding
- **Changes**:
  - Added property `this.eventsBindingSetup = false` in constructor
  - Added check in `bindEvents()` to prevent duplicate bindings

### 4. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed console logging to track initialization attempts
- Added constructor logging to detect multiple instance creation

## How the Fix Works

1. **Single Entry Point**: Only one initialization path exists now
2. **Instance Check**: Before creating a new instance, checks if one already exists
3. **Event Listener Protection**: Uses `{ once: true }` to ensure listeners only fire once
4. **Method-Level Safeguards**: Each setup method checks if it has already run

## Testing Verification
- Console logs will show "Creating new PromptHive instance" only once
- If duplicate initialization is attempted, logs will show "PromptHive already initialized, skipping duplicate initialization"
- Prompt cards should appear only once when reopening the extension
